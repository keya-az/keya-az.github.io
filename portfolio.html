              <div><h2>Woodland Haunt</h2><p>Woodland Haunt, created on Ableton Live 12 Suite in the Summer of 2024, utilizes tracks created using audio
                effects – such as compressor and EQ eight – MIDI effects, and instruments. With overlapping pre-made
                ambience tracks, 3D enhancement, and sound effects like glass shattering, this song is an immersive
                experience reminiscent of a magical journey through the woods. Woodland Haunt is fitting as background music
                for any such plot and creates a suspenseful, yet light musical environment for listeners. The song begins
                with a single track and grows in complexity as it reaches a peak bridge. At the bridge, all tracks fade away
                before reappearing for the outro again, closing out one-by-one until a singular track is left. The
                intermittent sound effects create a sense of an active environment with random objects intervening as one
                journeys through the song. The initiating and closing sound of glass-shattering creates a sense of
                foreboding as though this song is played in the middle of a tragic event, perhaps reminding one of a memory
                in the midst of tragedy. This is enunciated by the twinkling chimes in the bridge which further enhance a
                magical, whimsical feeling in the middle of the song that one could associate with nostalgic memories.</p></div>

                </div>
              <div><h2>How to Fill a Bucket</h2><p> Inspired by the children’s book "Have You Filled A Bucket Today?", this animation represents the act of
                spreading joy by passing positivity from your bucket to someone else’s. As a child, this children’s book was
                an impactful metaphor to being a light in people’s lives, even random passersby. It also served as a
                reminder that we have the power to dip into other people’s buckets too, and so we should be careful with our
                words and actions so we don’t leave others’ buckets empty. As in the season of giving, I created a winter
                setting for the December holiday season with matching music to recreate the joyful holiday spirit. The
                animation works by moving a smiling icon from one happy bucket to another sad bucket and when it is dropped
                in, the animation begins to play the song and the sad bucket begins to smile. Additionally, the initial
                bucket which is full of smiles also begins to glow when another bucket is filled. Other animations include
                the color changing feature of the smiling icons which makes the smiling bucket appear rainbow like with its
                array of colors.</p></div>

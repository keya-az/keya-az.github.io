                        <p>
                            Woodland Haunt, created on Ableton Live 12 Suite in the Summer of 2024, utilizes tracks
                            created using audio effects – such as compressor and EQ eight – MIDI effects, and
                            instruments. With overlapping pre-made ambience tracks, 3D enhancement, and sound effects
                            like glass shattering, this song is an immersive experience reminiscent of a magical journey
                            through the woods. Woodland Haunt is fitting as background music for any such plot and
                            creates a suspenseful, yet light musical environment for listeners. The song begins with a
                            single track and grows in complexity as it reaches a peak bridge. At the bridge, all tracks
                            fade away before reappearing for the outro again, closing out one-by-one until a singular
                            track is left. The intermittent sound effects create a sense of an active environment with
                            random objects intervening as one journeys through the song. The initiating and closing
                            sound of glass-shattering creates a sense of foreboding as though this song is played in the
                            middle of a tragic event, perhaps reminding one of a memory in the midst of tragedy. This is
                            enunciated by the twinkling chimes in the bridge which further enhance a magical, whimsical
                            feeling in the middle of the song that one could associate with nostalgic memories.</p>

                        <h2>How to Fill a Bucket</h2>
                        <p>
                            Inspired by the children’s book Have You Filled A Bucket Today?, this animation represents
                            the act of spreading joy by passing positivity from your bucket to someone else’s. As a
                            child, this children’s book was an impactful metaphor to being a light in people’s lives,
                            even random passersby. It also served as a reminder that we have the power to dip into other
                            people’s buckets too, and so we should be careful with our words and actions so we don’t
                            leave others’ buckets empty. As in the season of giving, I created a winter setting for the
                            December holiday season with matching music to recreate the joyful holiday spirit. The
                            animation works by moving a smiling icon from one happy bucket to another sad bucket and
                            when it is dropped in, the animation begins to play the song and the sad bucket begins to
                            smile. Additionally, the initial bucket which is full of smiles also begins to glow when
                            another bucket is filled. Other animations include the color changing feature of the smiling
                            icons which makes the smiling bucket appear rainbow like with its array of colors.

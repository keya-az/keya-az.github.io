        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am a third-year student majoring in Psychological & Brain Sciences and Sociology, and minoring
            in Media Arts & Design and Applied Psychology at UC Santa Barbara. I have always been fascinated by the
            intersection of creativity and the human experience, which inspires much of my artistic work. As such, I
            enjoy drawing from themes in nature, everyday life, and South Asian traditions for my creations.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I have explored a variety of mediums, including music, physical art, and media arts. My
            favorite visual designs often incorporate traditional henna patterns and florals. In music, I learned to
            play guitar, flute, and several other instruments, and I also experimented with DJ-ing. These musical
            pursuits have led me to compose original tracks in Ableton Live and enhance my media arts and
            videography.</p>
        <p>While I have worked in many mediums, I especially enjoy acrylic and watercolor painting, and I have
            recently been working on creating watercolor portraits. I also do hands-on crafts like jewelry design.
            Besides art, I like playing volleyball, painting, and going to movie nights with friends!</p>

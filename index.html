            <h2>About</h2>
            <p1> Hello! I am a third-year student majoring in Psychological & Brain Sciences and Sociology, and minoring
                in Media Arts & Design and Applied Psychology at UC Santa Barbara. I have always been fascinated by the
                intersection of creativity and the human experience, which inspires much of my artistic work. As such, I
                enjoy drawing from themes in nature, everyday life, and South Asian traditions for my creations.</p1>
            <p2> Over the years, I have explored a variety of mediums, including music, physical art, and media arts. My
                favorite visual designs often incorporate traditional henna patterns and florals. In music, I learned to
                play guitar, flute, and several other instruments, and I also experimented with DJ-ing. These musical
                pursuits have led me to compose original tracks in Ableton Live and enhance my media arts and
                videography.</p2>
            <p3> While I have worked in many mediums, I especially enjoy acrylic and watercolor painting, and I have
                recently been working on creating watercolor portraits. I also do hands-on crafts like jewelry design.
                Besides art, I like playing volleyball, painting, and going to movie nights with friends!
            </p3>

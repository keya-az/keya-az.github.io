      <h1>Keya Patel</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Keya Patel. I am a third-year student majoring in Psychological & Brain Sciences and Sociology, and minoring in Media Arts & Design and Applied Psychology. I have always been fascinated by the intersection of creativity and the human experience, which inspires much of my artistic work. As such, I enjoy drawing from themes in nature, everyday life, and South Asian traditions for my creations.
 
Over the years, I have explored a variety of mediums, including music, physical art, and media arts. My favorite visual designs often incorporate traditional henna patterns and florals. In music, I learned to play guitar, flute, and several other instruments, and I also experimented with DJ-ing. These musical pursuits have led me to compose original tracks in Ableton Live and enhance my media arts and videography.
While I have worked in many mediums, I especially enjoy acrylic and watercolor painting, and I have recently been working on creating watercolor portraits. I also enjoy hands-on crafts like jewelry design. Besides art, I also enjoy playing volleyball, painting, and going to movie nights with friends!</p>
